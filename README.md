## 🔐 Random Password Generator – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a simple web-based application that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences. The app was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, with a clean and responsive user interface.

### ✨ Features:

* Prompts the user to select:
  * Uppercase letters (A–Z)
  * Lowercase letters (a–z)
  * Numbers (0–9)
  * Special symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
* Users can choose **any combination** of character types.
* Passwords are generated instantly at the click of a button.

This project helped me practice:

* DOM manipulation and JavaScript event handling
* User input validation
* Working with arrays and randomization logic
